## About 

This is the **Module 02 Challenge Project**. The point of this project was to build a professional portfolio for myself with no starter code. It is meant to include a bio, my current work projects, and a contact list.

## The Purpose 

Applying CSS properties we had learned in week 2 was the main goal of this challenge. This is also our first challenge that had no starter code to work off of. We had to create all the files ourselves and format them correctly remembering to use semantic elements from our first challenge and remembering the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) methods.

## Usage
 
 This webpage is to be used as a portfolio/resume. It will be updated as I create and work on more projects so that future employers and peers may see what kind of applicatiuons I have worked on.
